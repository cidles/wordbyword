Description
-----------
WordByWord is a simple vocabulary trainer that takes an ordered list of
words in two languages and presents you the words in random order. You
may guess each word and then display the solution. WordByWord supports
several modes for learning: you may just display the words, answer
multiple choice questions or input the correct translation for the
given word.
WordByWord uses YAML input files and is based on the Qt Framework. The
program is written in Python. So WordByWord is platform independant, in
fact I wanted it to be usable on the Nokia N810 internet tablet in the
first place. See the screenshots on the side to see WordByWord running
on a desktop and on the tablet.

The software is licensed under the GNU General Public License.


Requirements
------------
You need to install the following packages to run WordByWord:

- Python
- PyQt
- PyYAML (is included in the Maemo download package)

This package contains the Python source of WordByWord (and for Maemo a
copy of PyYAML). So everything is included to start the program on any
platform, including the Nokia N810 internet tablet.


Usage
-----
Unpack the package and change into the created directory:

$ tar xzf wordbyword-0.2.0.tar.gz
$ cd wordbyword-0.2.0

Then, to start the program:

$ python wordbyword.py

A sample file for vocabulary learning (learning Portuguese for Germans)
is included in the package. Just open the file "courses/de-pt.yml" and
see WordByWord in action.
The sample file shows the how lessons and words are organized in YAML,
you may extend the file or write new YAML files according to the format
in the sample file.
